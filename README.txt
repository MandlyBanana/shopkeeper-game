Take home Project - Creating Classes and Dictionaries (Python)
1. Create a shop or a shopkeeper class.
    a. This class should store the shop’s inventory using a dictionary and the name of their shop.
            I. These should be initialized in the class constructor
    b. This class should have methods to handle the shopkeeper greeting a customer, listing the items that 
         they have in stock to a customer, allowing the customer to make orders, and charging the customer 
         for their order, and wishing the customer a good day.
2. Create a program that uses this shopkeeper class.
    a. The user should be the customer and able to interact with the shopkeeper.    
    b. Use the input function to allow the user to make choices and order items.
3. Challenge:  Make a program with a whole town of shops.  Allow the user to select what shops they want to go to.
